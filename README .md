# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to create a robust and accurate prediction model using various machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Preprocessed and cleaned heart disease dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Dockerized setup for consistent development and deployment.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more, which are used to predict the presence of heart disease.

**[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/)** (Add the specific link to the dataset here)

---

## Technologies Used

- Python (with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Docker
- Flask (for deployment)

---

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` folder.

---

## Steps to Run the Project with Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Prepare the Environment**
   Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` folder of the project.

3. **Build the Docker Image**
   Use the provided `Dockerfile` to build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t heart-disease-prediction .
   ```

4. **Run the Docker Container**
   Start the container to run the project:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 heart-disease-prediction
   ```

5. **Access the Application**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

6. **Perform Predictions**
   - Use the web interface to input patient data and predict the presence of heart disease.
   - Alternatively, you can interact with the API endpoint (e.g., using Postman).
